FundsIndia.com, based in Chennai, was founded in 2009 to provide online financial services to retail investors across the country and beyond. It manages mutual funds with retail assets worth Rs. 6,500 crore and houses over 330 employees. While pursuing their Masters in Computer Applications (MCA) at the University of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh in 1990, Chandrasekar and Srikanth shared a hostel room. After completing their postgraduate studies there, they both moved to the United States of America to pursue their doctorate degrees in Computer Science. Srikanth studied at the Oregon Graduate Institute in Portland, Oregon, while Chandrasekar completed his master’s degree at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. They both began their careers in the financial services industry, working in a range of high-profile positions for over a decade. After understanding that most platforms in the country only allowed online access to equity investing, they eventually decided to develop an online mutual fund investment website together. As a result of their consistent hard work and perseverance, on June 16, 2009, FundsIndia was launched.

FundsIndia is India’s first value-added investment platform. Wealth India Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. created and promotes the platform, which caters to retail Indian investors worldwide. Customers may gain access to a comprehensive range of investment products, including mutual funds from all Asset Management Firms (AMCs), equities from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), fixed deposits from companies, and more, by registering a FREE-for-life investing account. Built on robust technology, the platform is known for its exceptional value-added services that help clients get more out of their assets, such as Flexible Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), Value-averaging Investment Plans (VIPs), award-winning professional investment advice, Money Mitr, and more.

FundsIndia started out as a seller of mutual funds online and later diversified into other investment products including stocks, corporate fixed deposits, and bonds. Mutual funds still contribute 75% to 80% of its revenue. Its rapid expansion is fueled by a dynamic workforce with extensive expertise at prominent financial and digital firms, as well as startups in Silicon Valley and India.

Inventus Capital provided the firm with its first round of investment in 2010, and Foundation Capital provided the company with its second round of funding in 2012. In 2013, it introduced its first Robo Advisory service. Faering Capital led a Series C round of funding for 70 crores in 2015, with follow-on investments from current investors Foundation Capital and Inventus Capital Partners. The appointment of Girirajan Murugan as Chief Executive Officer and Suraj Kaeley as a Senior Advisor in the year 2019 signified the beginning of a new era for FundsIndia.

Girirajan is a seasoned business and technology leader with over two decades of experience and has been the Chief Technology Officer of the company for over 12 months. Suraj Kaeley is a veteran of the asset management industry who was most recently Group President Sales and Marketing of UTI Mutual Fund. Suraj has also worked with Fidelity, MetLife, and Franklin Templeton in senior roles.

Along with winning the hearts and minds of its users, FundsIndia also has some noteworthy achievements.
